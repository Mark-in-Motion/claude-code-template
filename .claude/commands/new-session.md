# New Development Session

Start a new development session by:

1. Reading `docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md` to understand the current project state
2. Getting today's date and creating a new session file at `docs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# Session: YYYY-MM-DD

## Focus
[One sentence describing what this session will accomplish]

## Goals
- [ ] Goal 1
- [ ] Goal 2

## Progress

### Completed
(fill in as work is done)

### Blockers
(note any issues encountered)

## Next Steps
(fill in at end of session)
```

3. Asking the user: "What is the focus for this session?"
4. Filling in the Focus and Goals sections based on their answer
5. Confirming the session file was created and is ready

Do not read `docs/ACTIVE_ROADMAP.md` unless the user asks — keep session startup fast.
